/**
 * FUNCTIONS: 
 * 
 * The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a 
 * function?) a function by?
 * What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
 * What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
 * How do we assign a function to a variable?
 * Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do
 * we specify outputs?
 * Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
 * Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and 
 * is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these 
 * closures!
