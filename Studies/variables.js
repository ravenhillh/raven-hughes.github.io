/**
 * 
 * VARIABLES: 
 * 
 * 0. Variables are used to record data and attach it to a label to have access to that data. They
 * can store any type of data, such as string, number, boolean or objects. They are called variables
 * because you can change they're values or change the type of data they point at.
 * 
 * 1. The first thing you do is create a variable or declare it with a name, and the keywords, var,
 * let or const.
 * 2. The second part step is called assignment or initialization. This is when you assign a value to 
 * the variable.

//Declaration
//Declaration is when you create a variable and name it, but without assigning it a value.
var myDog
console.log(myDog) //prints undefined, because variable has no value yet

//Initialization or Assignment
//Assignment or initialization is when you assign a value to your variable.

var myDog = "Burt"
console.log(myDog) //prints Burt to the console

//Re-assignment
//When you change the value of a variable.

var myDog = "Sally"
console.log(myDog) // logs Sally to the console
