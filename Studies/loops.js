/**
 * 
 * LOOPS: Loops are a way to repeat one piece of code over and over a set number of times. There are many different 
 * types of loops, but they basically do the same thing, repeat a piece of code a certain amount of times. Different 
 * types of loops provide different ways to start and stop the looping process. Each of these different loop types
 * are more suited for particular situations. With a loop you can either iterate through a data structure, such as an
 * object or an array, or you can just use the index number of the loop to do something at each index.
 * 
 * 1. While loops are used to loop while a certain condition is true, once the condition resolves to false the 
 * loop will stop iterating. You can also use a counter n to increment and decide where to start and stop the 
 * iteration.
 * 
 * 2. For loops iterate for a certain number of times, until it meets the stopping condition. It uses an incrementer
 * to move the loop and for each index it executes the code block. Once the stopping condition resolves to true the 
 * loop stops. They can iterate through an array or just count and do something at each index.
 * 
 * 3. For-in loops are used to iterate through an object, using a specified key and object. It runs the block of code
 * at each property in the given object. The loop ends after hitting each property.
 * 
 * 4. You can loop to any point, going forward, by creating a stopping point with the stopping condition, and iterating
 * forward with i + 1. You can loop backwards starting at any point with the starting condition of i a given number,
 * and stopping condition of i > 0, and using i -1 to increment backwards.
 * 
 * 5. Loop over an Array, forwards and backwards
Loop over an Object
