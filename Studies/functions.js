/**
 * FUNCTIONS: 
 * A function is a piece of code designed to perform a particular task. First you must define a function with the 
 * keyword function, then name the function, and then put parentheses, in which you can place parameters. Next you
 * place the code block within curly braces, this is where you write your code that will perform the function's task.
 * Now that you have created the function or defined it, you can invoke or call the function. This is done by
 * writing the name of the function followed by parentheses, which will hold the arguments you are passing in
 * to the function.
 * 
 * The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a 
 * function?) a function by?
 * 
 * 1. When you define a function you create how ever many parameters it may need, inside the parentheses, these are 
 * basically placeholders, which are named so that you have an idea what the function input it, such as num1 and num2.
 * When you invoke a function you pass in the arguments that you would like to use as input for your function, they
 * are going to be used within the function, it could be numbers or a string or object, or even another function.
 * 
 * 2. A named function is written by first putting the function keyword and then the name of the function, then
 * parentheses, with some or no parameters, and then curly braces, in which your code block will go.
 * 
 * 3. If we want to assign a function to a variable we can just say let or const and the name of the function is 
 * equal to function and then put our parentheses, with parameters, and then put curly braces, with the code block
 * inside.
 * 
 * 4. Functions can take inputs, they are passed in as arguments to the function. Functions can return a value, this
 * is done with a return statement at the end of our code block, which specifies what will be returned.
 * 
 * 5. Scope can exist at the function level or at the global level. 
 * Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
 * Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and 
 * is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these 
 * closures!
